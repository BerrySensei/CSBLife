Dear Vanilla, (You know what Vanilla? . . . Of course you don't know.)

What happened today.

What happened today was.

What I noticed though is that it was quite unusual for our class or for me to go home early. I probably just got used to the usual practices or 'busyness' that we do after classes.

Then, there are also other things that happened that is too personal to tell soooo, not telling anything. I guess that's it. XD
