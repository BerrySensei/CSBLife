Reflection for Frosh Orientation Program:

<i>What I expected in this orientation is not really a bonding type of program, rather just a long discussion about DLS-CSB and some rules and regulations, but, I found out I was wrong when the orientators started separating us by section. I was really nervous back then because, I'm about to enter to a whole new level and I'm about to meet more  frosh like me that I wasn't exactly sure if my fast heart beats was because of both excitement and nervousness or just plain anxiety, but, during the day as I expected, I learned a lot of things about DLS-CSB and how the people, who had been part of the CSB family already, will interact with you and how friendly they are; Our orientators, who were the ones in charge of us, also toured us around the school to prevent us from being lost on the first day. All the anxiety and/or nervousness gradually decreased as I went on and met more people. I thought everything would just be the same as before that I'll be the typical quiet 'smart' girl I am, but I was encouraged to speak up so I did.  My tension was easily taken away and my usual anxiety disappeared and everything seemed to feel rushed that in a blink of an eye, the day already ended. I regretted a bit that I didn't get to actively talk much to others only a few, but, I knew now that in the first day, I should be more open and be more active in getting to know my blockmates for the first term.</i>
