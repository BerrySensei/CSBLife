Guide Questions and Reflection for Healed Hearts:

1. Give at least (2) Benildean Core Values shown on the production.
3. How do handle your own grief?
2. How can you share these values to others?
4. How does it affect you as part of the Lasallian community?
5. Give your own personal insights about the show.

<i>In this event, there are Benildean Core Values presented. One is that of Social Responsibility, in which we should be sensitive of others' needs and not only your own needs, because in a way, it'll affect your behavior and yourself, entirely. Another is that of Deeply rooted in Faith, in which whatever problems you have share it with God and don't be consumed in self-grief. God will talk to you, because He will always be there for you. By giving advices to other people, helping other people to control and being sensitive to others' well-being, I can share these values and as a part of the Lasallian community, I should take part of organizations that can cater to people's needs and help them in any way I can to remove their grievances.</i>
