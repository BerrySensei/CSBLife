Journal Title:  MORE PE

Dear Vanilla, (I decided not to and chose to remain you as Vanilla)
Okayyyyy. Let's see. Bibstud was a success (Sorta?) aaaaand we walked a long way to Jollibee today because, we couldn't decide where to eat lunch. In other words, we made ourselves tired before getting any food.

AND! FINALLY! My financial crisis  ended....TEMPORARILY. Better than nothing, right? 

Hmm....and I realized that I went back home today from school late. (Although, not much of a big deal compared to the time I get home when I come from a blockmate's house, but still!) Reason? PE. There's no other choice because, tomorrow is already the finals for PE. Not exactly as the whole finals, but the grade for tomorrow is 50% so, if I don't get a high score...bye bye, DL. (Yes, I AM aiming for Dean's Lister, hopefully, I'll make it :D).

Oh and I learned more about the DREADED talumpati today. Sadly :'(, I'm the third one to perform for August 23, 2011. The only bright side is that the professor that will grade me is a professor I'm used to, so I don't have to adjust and I had a bit of a self-confidence boost.

Now, I'm just sleepy. I guess I ate too much before leaving school for home. Haha. Anywaaaays, I'm just happy yet melancholic (o.O how could that happeng at the same time?! Irony/Contradiction?!) for todayyyyyy. Not like you're interested in my mood today, Vanilla. Just to let you know, I was irritated so much today and since yesterday, but I controlled myself, luckily :D

I guess that's alllllll~
