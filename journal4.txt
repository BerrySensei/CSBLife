Journal Title:  Nice oneeeee~

Dear Vanilla, (Now, I'm bored with you Vanilla...)

Bad news: My body ached all over. Good news: I'm finally done with that practical on PE. More Bad news: I'm getting even more anxious with the talumpati. More Good news: I was finally able to finish typing my talumpati.

Some other news: our group will have our last shooting for our history project on Saturday. We will FINALLY get done with it.

Nothing much happened, really. Just more boringness from me. I apologize for the lack of uhhh interesting stories to tell. :D

-Z is bored, this girl's signing out :D
