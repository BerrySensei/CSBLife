Journal Title: Stage Fright

Dear Vanilla, (Do you know what it means to be scared, Vanilla?!)

Okay, so the talumpati thing is getting even near and I'm still not memorizing what I wrote (or typed) for the talumpati....
.

In conclusion, what I did today is to tire myself until I memorize this piece of crap of a talumpati. (The piece of crap that's going to save my Filipino project's life, FYI.)

As usual, after tiring myself with that talumpati, I went back to socializing then sleeping then socializing while memorizing then sleeping then waking up the next day, finding myself...I DID IT! Huzzah! But that's a story for another day...(which is actually tomorrow...What the heck am I saying?!)

I've done nothing much..today. Just the usual. :D

- Z is signing out and is currently rising from the dead due to the piece of crap's temptation to make me memorize and master it more :D (Whew, that was a long sign out..)
