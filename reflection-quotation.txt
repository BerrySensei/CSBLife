<body><b><i>Quoted from St. John Baptist de La Salle:</i></b>
<center><i>"It seems to me, that there is no better way to begin the schools well than to put the teachers who will be there under the protection of one of the parish pastors willing to take them in and to say that he is employing them for the instruction of his people."</i></center><br>
&nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; The way I analyzed it, St. John Baptist de La Salle was having a hard time starting this mission of his because of opposition and so, he planned to put the teachers under a parish pastor. His plan of free education to the people will be realized as soon as he finds an ally from the church. He may have been part of the church; however, some of the higher authorities of the church won't agree, but with the help of others, relying on others' help, he was able to convince the opposition. Soon enough, the church accepted what de La Salle had wanted to happen and recognized him for it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;  &nbsp; &nbsp; From the quotation, he was also trying to say that he needed a means of letting the opposition agree, in order for him to truly begin what he wanted for the people especially to the children. In another perspective, putting the teachers under a parish pastor will also help the teachers, because they will be guided since the teachers specialized in academic matters. Whereas to the pastor, he will be able to teach them more about the church and the religion, molding a future curriculum for the school that de La Salle wanted, which is the foundation of the La Sallian schools of today.
