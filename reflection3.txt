<i>In the second part of the play, one can prevent this by being a steward to the environment, the animals and the people around you. Keep everything balanced. As part of the La Sallian community, I am encouraged and obliged to serve as a model in being a steward to mother earth, because in the story, what happened was that everything was destroyed. What God slowly and preciously created was destroyed and to prevent this is to prevent and stop pollution and a remedial to the damage that the people did today. Another insight is that one can see some Benildean Core Values like Social Responsibility, in which we should be responsible to everything around us not only to the people but to the non-living things surrounding us and Deeply Rooted in Faith, in which we should not always lose hope in problems like pollution and such because such problems were given to us as a test from God, because, He wants us to take care of His creations.</i>
