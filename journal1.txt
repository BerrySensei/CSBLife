Journal Title:  I'm gonna start calling my journal Vanilla for a random reason.

Dear Vanilla,
As usual, I'm thinking about the finances at home. Since the money hasn't come yet for our monthly budget, I'm still analyzing how to budget the money that was left from last month. I hope that I'll finally get the budget for this month. I'm reminding my parents again.

 Then, there's this girl problem that I had today, in which I won't ever probably talk about 'cause I'm making this public.

Hmm...
Hmm...
Hmm...

I ran out on what to talk about. Well, I managed to..umm...practice drawing? Well, actually, I just doodled...And now, I'm thinking about what I will do tomorrow. There's practice then the bibstud thing then practice then the bibstud thing then I'm still thinking about what will I talk about in Filipino for the talumpati then the practice then still the bibstud thing and the quiz for compfun then more practice and bibstud thing.

I just realized...I have such a monotonous life. I wish something exciting happens, but then again, if it did, it'll probably just bothersome and will ruin the schedule/plans (Do I even have one?). 

I'm....such a busy person. (Liar) So, uh, even though I'm a girl, I won't ever express too much here 'cause like I said: I'm making this public. At the very least, I learned more anatomy today from my classmate's sketch other than the usual academics. I just have to practice. I have to concentrate for my finals though.

I think these are the only things in my head right now, other than the numbers counting in my head repeatedly (16-count rhythm that one uses for dancing). I blame that on PE.

I guess that's it.

- This is Z, signing out from this, uh, journal. :D
