<i>What is NSTP? NSTP is what you call a National Service Training Program. Its aim is to enhance nationalism, defense preparedness, self-awareness and civic consciousness. What the NSTP does in nation-building is to improve in teamwork and unity, in which we can find a way to do something to help everbody not just one person. There are three program components. First is that of ROTC. ROTC deals with military training that will motivate, train and mobilize the youth for national defense preparedness. Second is that of CWTS. CWTS provides an opportunity for the youth to provide energy, time and talent and even resources to other Filipinos. Last but not the least, LTS, in which the youth is given the chance to become a teacher to the younger generation in terms of mathematical abilities, reading and writing. Among these three programs, I plan to take up CWTS, because, I don't have much patience for teaching other people, in which we should do in LTS and I am rather too weak in physical activities that I may not last in ROTC. Taking up at least one NSTP program can help us become a good Filipino citizen and good Benildean-Lasallian. By participating in its activities that will build up support and teamwork, we can all team up to help other Filipinos and give service to them if needed, not just only Benildean-Lasallians. </i>
