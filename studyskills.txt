<b>Have you ever failed an exam? What were the reasons for failing?</b>
<i>Yes, I have failed not only once but many times; however, they were quizzes instead. I think I failed in those quizzes, becaue I forgot to study fo those quizzes and usually, the quizzes that I fail are those of surprise quizzes.</i>

<b> For those who haven't failed an exam, what was your highest score in an exam? What do you think made you reach the top? (If you cannot answer this question, why are you not answering this question?)</b>
<i>I am not answering this question, because, like I said, I failed in some quizzes and that I think, it would be very much impossible not to fail at least once in your lifetime. You have to learn from your failures in order to, be as perfect as you can and not commit the same mistakes over and over again.</i>

<b> How was your first experience of DLS-CSB Midterm Examinations? Knowing what you know now, what would you have done differently? What are you going to do again for the CSB Finals?</b>
<i>My first experience so far was okay, I just had problems on managing my time, because the mid terms and projects had to be done simultaneously. I would've improved on time management and putting away distractions during that period so that, I could've concentrated more on studying. What I'm going to do again though, is to take down more notes and study even harder.</i>
