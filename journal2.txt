Journal Title:  Complication

Dear Vanilla, (I might change your name though)
The day was tiring as usual. Well, we managed to finish the bibstud thing I kept on ranting about from the last entry. PE Practice was kind of okay, just a bit of a problem of mastery (for the other parts that's not dance aerobics) and the endurance (for the 20-minute dance aerobics).

For today....hmm...there weren't much difference at all except the practices and again the bibstud thing, but, when we were practicing for PE, before we left, we ate pizza. (What the heck?) I gave such importance to that uhhh event because, I only get to eat it from someone else's home or if it's free. (I did mention I was having some problems in the financial aspect)

Did I learn something? Well, uh, kinda, when we were doing alice during compfun and the comments and discussions (from our class fb group) on how to make the character walk helped a bit of making me understand. In the end, I was still confused unfortunately.

Other than those happenings, I can say it was just a normal day. :D

PS. I bet you people think my life is boring. XD
