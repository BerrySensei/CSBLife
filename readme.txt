Frosh</title>
<head>Level up!</head><hr>
<body>
Upon entering college, new things kept on coming. The typical things that I did<BR>
when I was back in high school had gone and vanished. Waiting for the school service,<br>
wearing uniforms and some other daily routines that I did died out. This time I have to<br>
walk from my rented condo to my school, no more school service. This time I have to wear<br>
new dress codes and casual clothes instead of a uniform. This time I have to look for a<br>
fast food chain or other places to eat, not anymore the 'baon' or packed lunch. So much<br>
have changed since I started and a few remained the same.<br><br>

During the orientation, we, the frosh, had been set into new roles. Unlike the high school<br>
days, our role has been changed, my role has been changed. Before, my only role was to study,<br>
my only goal was to finish and graduate. Being a college student now, the role, instead of<br>
mediocrity, the role now is to study with a goal of being a Game Designer and Developer<br>
Professional. My role now is higher, because, I will be one of the future generations that<br>
will establish development in the gaming industry. All of us GDD students ARE the future of<br>
the gaming industry of the Philippines.<br><br>

As more days passed, from the first day of school, I have built new relationships, new circle<br>
of friends that differed compared in the past. These people, my blockmates, will become the people<br>
that will help me in the future, because, they are only people who will understand what you are<br>
talking about.<br><br>

Along with them, we create new assumptions of what will happen to us in our college days. Before,
<br>we expect to learn the basics, the general subjects. Now, we expect to learn about the course
<br>that we chose, to become a professional, an expert of the chosen course. I assume to learn more
<br>about computers, about creating games, animations and codes. I expect to learn and in the future,
<br>to be able to use them in order to pursue the dream of becoming a game developer/designer or better
<br>yet become a CEO of your own game/software company.
