<i>Upon entering college, new things kept on coming. The typical things that I did when I was back in high school had gone and vanished. Waiting for the school <br>service,wearing uniforms and some other daily routines that I did died out. This time I have to walk from my rented condo to my school, no more school service. <br>This time I have to wear new dress codes and casual clothes instead of a uniform. This time I have to look for a fast food chain or other places to eat, not anymore <br> the 'baon' or packed lunch. So much have changed since I started and a few remained the same.<br><br>

During the orientation, we, the frosh, had been set into new roles. Unlike the high school days, our role has been changed, my role has been changed. Before, my only <br>role was to study, my only goal was to finish and graduate. Being a college student now, the role, instead of mediocrity, the role now is to study with a goal of being <br>a Game Designer and Developer Professional. My role now is higher, because, I will be one of the future generations that will establish development in the <br>gaming industry. All of us GDD students ARE the future of the gaming industry of the Philippines.<br><br>

As more days passed, from the first day of school, I have built new relationships, new circle of friends that differed compared in the past. These people, my <br>blockmates, will become the people that will help me in the future, because, they are only people who will understand what you are talking about.<br><br>

Along with them, we create new assumptions of what will happen to us in our college days. Before, we expect to learn the basics, the general subjects. Now, we <br>expect to learn about the course that we chose, to become a professional, an expert of the chosen course. I assume to learn more about computers, about <br>creating games, animations and codes. I expect to learn and in the future, to be able to use them in order to pursue the dream of becoming a game <br>developer/designer or better yet become a CEO of your own game/software company.</i>
