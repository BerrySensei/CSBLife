<i>Among the Benildean Core Values, I have learned more about the creativity, portrayed by the shadow play for creating shadows as their medium of telling a story. Another is that of faith, portrayed by the family in the story of the shadow play. The child had enough faith that her mother will return and the parents had enough faith towards God that they will eventually have a blessed and unique child, in which they were given, though it was one of God's angels. What I liked the most is how the shadows told the story. As a Benildean-Lasallian, I am challenged to be more creative and improve on certain ideas in which I can make a basis on how the shadow play did. Since I'm a GDD student, I can have the shadow play as basis for a certain game and make it more unique. Other than the technical things, I learned a lot of the moral values presented in the story: the respect for the parents is seen there and the faith in God. The story presented can serve as a guide or a teaching value to every person in the audience.</i>
