Journal Title: SWIM, FISHY, SWIMMMMM!!!!

Dear Vanilla, (Does Vanilla taste good with water? WATDAIDONTEVENKNOWWHA-!)

Okay...for the whole day. What we did....are practically academic nonsense. (Well, not really, seeing that projects are of HUGE importance.) We finally finished shooting the troublesome project. Now one of my groupmates just have to edit it. Another groupmate and I helped in putting it in sequence to make it easier for the editor.

Now...what I learned today is the interface and a bit of Sony Vegas, when I saw the other group's editor working on their video. Well, I may have not absorbed much, but, at least I know what it looked like XD!

Theeeeennnn, after the project-making....HERE COMES THE FUN! We swam and swam and swam and swam and swam like the little fishies we are. Haha. Other than that, we just played around like we were still little kids and while swimming, I realized... 

I'm still short...
I never grew at all...
I'm still short...
I lack endurance underwater...
I'm still short...
I easily get out of breath...
I'm still short
I'm such a slow swimmer...
AND
I'm FREAKIN' SHORT!

Wow. Bitter much. Well, I blame myself for not taking afternoon naps when I was a kid, for not drinking milk because of my certain dislike to the drink and for not doing much stretching exercises. Resulting to THAT.

Anyways, no more other things to explain, to say, to....whatever. I don't know, Vanilla. These are the only things that I can remember doing for the day AND I'm tired, so I'm going back to sleep mode. See ya and FISH out! :D
